        <h3>ETL Pipeline using Airflow for House Data Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Apache Airflow, Python, AWS S3, AWS QuickSight, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization</p>
        <p>
          This project involved creating an automated ETL pipeline to fetch house data from AWS S3, clean and transform it, then load the processed data back to S3. The cleaned data was then visualized using AWS QuickSight to generate insightful dashboards for analysis and decision making. This pipeline enabled scalable and efficient data processing and reporting.

        <h3>YouTube Transcript Summarizer</h3>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, NLP, Hugging Face Transformers, Facebook's BART Model, Large Language Models (LLMs), Flask</p>
        <p>
          Developed a YouTube transcript summarizer using advanced NLP techniques and transformer models. This tool extracts video transcripts via YouTube API, preprocesses text with tokenization and sentence ranking, then generates concise summaries using Facebook's BART model. The project is deployed as a Flask web app providing an intuitive interface for users to get quick video summaries, enhancing content accessibility and saving viewer time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project highlights practical skills in API integration, transformer-based NLP, and building AI-powered applications to improve digital content consumption.

        <h3>Pharmaceutical Sales Data Dashboard</h3>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, SQL, Tableau, AWS Redshift, Data Modeling</p>
        <p>
          Created an interactive sales data dashboard for PharmaACE using Tableau connected to AWS Redshift. The project involved querying large-scale pharmaceutical sales data, cleaning and modeling it for efficient retrieval, and designing visualizations that provide actionable insights on sales trends, regional performance, and product demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dashboard supports dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions that improve sales strategies and market reach.
